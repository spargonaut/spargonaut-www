      <description>FOSS Flight is the beginnings of an Eletronic Flight Bag (EFB).
I started FOSSFlight due to an interest in exploring Android development as well as a lot of frustrations with general aviation and the mobile apps that go with it.
I was frustrated with the quality of the EFBs and their ability to create, modify and use checklists, the most basic of tools used by pilots when flying.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also been frustrated with the cost of everything needed by the student pilot and the other non-commercial aviation enthusiasts.</description>
