    <p>FOSS Flight is the beginnings of an Eletronic Flight Bag (EFB).</p>

<p>I started FOSSFlight due to an interest in exploring Android development as well as a lot of frustrations with general aviation and the mobile apps that go with it.<br />
I was frustrated with the quality of the EFBs and their ability to create, modify and use checklists, the most basic of tools used by pilots when flying.<br />
I&rsquo;ve also been frustrated with the cost of everything needed by the student pilot and the other non-commercial aviation enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Put all of the above together, and I had a nice bit of motivation.  Hence, FOSSFlight was born.</p>

<p>I approached the project the same way I approach any other software project, with testing and continious delivery as first class citizens.  I wanted to be as meticulious with FOSSFlight as A&amp;Ps are when maintaining aircraft.</p>

<p>The project is <a href="https://gitlab.com/Spargonaut/FOSSFlight-Checklists">open source</a>.  The <a href="http://fossflight.org/">website</a> has more information and some useful links, or you can install it from the play store.</p>
