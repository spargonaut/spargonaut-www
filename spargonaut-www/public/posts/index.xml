      <description>When I started with Kotlin in the spring of 2018, it had already been on my radar for a while. My reluctance to hang out on the bleeding edge and various other reasons kept me from diving into it before that.
Once I got started though, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really looked back, and it has quickly become one of my most favorite languages to program with. I feel like I find a new reason to love it more every day.</description>

      <description>This post is a reposting of one of my favorite blog posts about unit tests. It was originally posted by one of my colleagues at ThoughtWorks, but it came down when he decided to redesign his blog. I found it when I was starting out with unit testing and TDD and I think these rules really helped me to write some really good tests. Small, fast, and easy to maintain.</description>

Well, this is awkward. Sorry, I&amp;rsquo;m not blogging. Not yet, anyway.
In the mean time, you can enjoy my pithy, preachy tweets, or listen to me and some friends talk about software engineering over on the Devs talking podcast</description>
