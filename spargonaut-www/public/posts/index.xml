      <description>Lets Get good with git!
Over the course of my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve used a variety of programming languages, IDEs and other tools to write software.
One tool that has almost always been there, is Git.
These are some of my favorite resources for learning, brushing up, or simply playing with git.
 learngitbranching.js.org  The tutorials are great, and they come with a CLI to practice your git commands This site is probably my favorite in this list because it builds a diagram of your commit stack as you run the commands in the tutorials.</description>

      <description>When I started with Kotlin in the spring of 2018, it had already been on my radar for a while. My reluctance to hang out on the bleeding edge and various other reasons kept me from diving into it before that.
Once I got started though, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really looked back, and it has quickly become one of my most favorite languages to program with. I feel like I find a new reason to love it more every day.</description>

      <description>This post is a reposting of one of my favorite blog posts about unit tests. It was originally posted by one of my colleagues at ThoughtWorks, but it came down when he decided to redesign his blog. I found it when I was starting out with unit testing and TDD and I think these rules really helped me to write some really good tests. Small, fast, and easy to maintain.</description>
